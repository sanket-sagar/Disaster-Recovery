Multi-Region Disaster Recovery Setup

Objective

To design and implement a multi-region disaster recovery solution using AWS services, where infrastructure is deployed in two AWS regions. The solution will replicate data across regions, ensure high availability, and implement a failover mechanism for disaster recovery. The project involves using Terraform to provision infrastructure, and CI/CD pipelines to ensure both regions remain synchronized for disaster recovery and failover.
